    <h2>Context and Project Definition</h2>
    <p>In a context where awareness of the importance of health is constantly growing, the need for consumers to easily
        access reliable and understandable information about the products they consume has become paramount. This
        project aims to meet this requirement by developing a digital solution that allows scanning of food product
        labels, thus offering an instant analysis of their composition. This project aims to make product information
        transparent and accessible to all, contributing to improving quality of life.</p>

    <h2>Project Objective</h2>
    <p>The main objective of this project is to develop a mobile application that facilitates access to detailed and
        reliable information on the composition of food products, in order to improve consumers' decision-making
        regarding their health. To achieve this overall objective, the project focuses on three specific objectives:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Designing an accessible and intuitive user interface: The objective is to enable a smooth and pleasant user
            experience, thereby reducing the learning curve and increasing user engagement.</li>
        <li>Integrating a product search function: Developing a feature that allows users to instantly access detailed
            information about a given product.</li>
        <li>Providing ingredient analysis: Offering users clear and accurate information about ingredients. The goal is
            to help consumers understand the impact of their dietary choices on their health and make informed decisions
            about their diet.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project Scope</h2>
    <p>The scope of this project includes the development of a mobile application dedicated to promoting healthy and
        informed eating for consumers.</p>

    <h2>Functional Description of Requirements</h2>
